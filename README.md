Home of JP Ferguson's bibtex file

This file has the name "generals.bib" because I first created it in March 2005 when I began compiling a reading list for my general exams in the PhD program at MIT Sloan. The general exams and second-year paper seemed the right place to invest in LaTeX. If I kept at it, perhaps I could reuse the file! Nearly twenty years later, this is still where I add references for research papers. Anyone is free to clone.
